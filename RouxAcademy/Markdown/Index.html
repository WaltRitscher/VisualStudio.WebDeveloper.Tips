<p>Here at Roux, we’re as excited for the upcoming school year as we are this one. Visiting professors <strong>Barry Mandow</strong> (renowned photojournalist) and Rebecca Short (textile designer) will be joining us in the fall and construction on the Roux North remodel will be completed by October 2018.</p>
<p>Registration for the Fall 2018 semester opens July 13th. Current students: don’t forget to sign up for your registration appointment. If you’re a prospective student looking to apply to Roux, now is the time to meet with a counselor to polish up those last remaining application details and complete any necessary paperwork for grants and scholarships.
