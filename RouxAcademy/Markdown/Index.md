## Fall registration is now open

Here at Roux, we’re as excited for the upcoming school year as we are this one. Visiting professors **Barry Mandow** (renowned photojournalist) and Rebecca Short (textile designer) will be joining us in the fall and construction on the Roux North remodel will be completed by October 2018.

Registration for the Fall 2018 semester opens July 13th. Current students: don’t forget to sign up for your registration appointment. If you’re a prospective student looking to apply to Roux, now is the time to meet with a counselor to polish up those last remaining application details and complete any necessary paperwork for grants and scholarships.
